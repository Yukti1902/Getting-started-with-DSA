# Getting Started with DSA

Welcome to the **Getting Started with DSA** repository!  
This project contains simple Java implementations of fundamental Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) concepts designed for beginners who want to build a solid foundation in problem-solving.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The goal of this repository is to help beginners learn DSA patterns step by step through practical examples.  
Each folder contains organized, easy-to-understand code for a specific core DSA concept.
